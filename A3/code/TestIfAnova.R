TestIfAnova <- function(dataset, groups, significanceLevel) {
  # Given a dataset, the current function checks if all the required assumptions
  # to perform an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are met or not.
  #
  # Args:
  #   dataset: A dataframe with the observed data.
  #   groups: The different groups considered in this exercise.
  #   significanceLevel: The significance level to consider in the tests.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   A boolean value, indicating if the ANOVA can, or cannot, be performed.

  # Let numberAgeGroups <- length(groups).
  # We will create "numberAgeGroups" groups. These will be our Xi. Each group
  # will have a dimension ni (for i ranging from 1 to "numberAgeGroups").
  # For each group we have observed a sample (xi_1, ... , xi_ni), and each xi_j
  # is an observation of a random variable Xi_j.
  # For each of these variables the following properties will have to be
  # verified:
  #   1) Each random variable Xi_j follows a Normal Distribution.
  #   2) All "numberAgeGroups" samples are independent from each other.
  #   3) All "numberAgeGroups" samples have the same variance.
  #
  
  # Property 1: Each random variable Xi_j follows a normal distribution
  # To verify this property we must check, for each group, is the observed
  # sample (xi_1, ... , xi_ni) can be obtained from a Normal Distribution.

  # Property 2: Yes, the samples are independent from each other
  # TODO(jpleitao): How to exactly justify this???
  
  # Property 3: Test if all the "numberAgeGroups" samples have the same variance
  #
  # I HAVE ONE QUESTION HERE: By saying that the samples have to have the same
  # variance are we saying that the variance of the observed samples has to be
  # the same or that the variance of the populations of the samples have to be
  # the same? The first hypothesis seems a bit harsh, so I'am pretty sure it is
  # the second one!
