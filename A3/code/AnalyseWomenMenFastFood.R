  # Args:
  #   dataset: A dataframe with the observed data.
  
  # TODO(jpleitao):
  # VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: My problem here is whether or not I can perform a
  # T-Test, because both X and Y do not follow a Normal Distribution, but their
  # respective lengths are considerably higher than 30 (they are both higher
  # than 100...). However, if I invoke the Central Limit Theorem to state that
  # the means of samples approach a Normal Distribution (and therefore I can
  # satfisfy the assumptions of the T-Test) I get a very high p-value when the
  # means of both variables are considerably different: mean(X) = 2.586310 and
  # mean(Y) = 3.616477 (Recall that H0: mx - my = 0 vs H1: mx - my > 0).
  # So it doesn't make much sense to actually accept the null hypothesis and say
  # that X and Y have the same mean (or at least say that we do not have enough
  # statistical evidence to reject their mean equality).
  #
  # Is it possible that I cannot invoke the central limit theorem here??

  # Even though both X and Y variables do not follow a normal distribution,

  # higher than 30 (168 for women and 176 for men) we can still aplly the T-Test
  # for the mean difference of two populations, obtaining an approximate

  # Furthermore, because X and Y are independent, we will be applying the T-Test

  # this exercise is to evaluate whether or not the variances of X and Y are
  # equal. Such evaluation can be achieved by performing the Levene's Test.
